    <h2> Life Cycle</h2>
    <p> For stars, those colossal celestial bodies that dot the nighttime sky, their life cycles run into billions of years and dramatic changes. 
      It's a sojourn that sculpts the cosmos around them from birth in massive clouds of gas and dust to eventual death. The life cycle of a star commences within the densest regions of interstellar gas and dust, called the molecular clouds. It is here that gravity sets the star-forming process in place. 
As regions with densities higher than other parts of the cloud collapse under the effect of their own gravity, they turn into protostars—dense, hot cores circled by rotating disks of gas and dust. As they keep gathering material from their surroundings, these protostars grow into young stars.
Once a protostar reaches a critical mass, nuclear fusion is ignited within its core. Due to the resulting intensity of heat and pressure from fusion reactions, it releases energy in the form of light and heat, thus entering the main sequence phase. This is the stable equilibrium stage between the inward pull of gravity and the outward pressure of radiation, where the stars stay for the greater part of their lives.
For stars like our Sun, this phase lasts billions of years as they slowly burn up all their hydrogen into helium inside the cores. However, stars do come in a variety of masses, and the length of time a star remains on the main sequence depends directly on its mass. High-mass stars burn up their fuel much faster than their low-mass cousins, which means they would have shorter lifetimes on the main sequence.
As a star uses up its hydrogen fuel in its core, nuclear reactions slow down, causing the core to contract and heat up, while the outer layers of the star expand and cool, turning the star into a red giant or supergiant. During this phase, certain stars, depending on their mass, may experience additional fusion processes involving helium or even heavier elements.
In the final analysis, the destiny of a star is determined by its mass. Stars of low to medium mass, like our Sun, will eventually lose their outer layers, creating colorful clouds of gas and dust called planetary nebulae, while the core that remains behind, now extremely dense, cools slowly over billions of years as a white dwarf—the remnant core of the star shrunken down to the size of Earth.
High-mass stars end their lives in much more dramatic fashion. When they have spent all their nuclear fuel, they contract with such force that they explode as a supernova. During a supernova, massive stars expel great amounts of matter into space, enriching the interstellar medium with heavy elements needed for new star and planetary formation.
Remnants from supernovae depend on the mass of the star. Some will leave behind very dense, spinning cores known as neutron stars, while very massive stars will collapse into a singularity so dense that not even light can escape—the mysterious objects called black holes.
In this way, the life cycle of stars weaves together a tapestry of cosmic evolution, shaping both the composition and structure of galaxies over enormous time periods. From the peaceful radiance of newly born stars to the explosive finishes of supernovae, each stage in the life of a star plays its role in this astounding tapestry of the universe—a testimony to the power and complexity of the cosmos.
