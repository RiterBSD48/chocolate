    <h2> Life Cycle</h2>
    <p> The life cycle of a star is often longer than our puny human minds can comprehend. It starts in vast nebuluae, and ends either quietly, or in a blaze of glory.</p>
    <p> All stars are made up of mostly hydrogen and helium gas. This gas is from nebulae, which are much colder than their eventual blazing counterparts. </p> 
    <p> This gas slowly clumps together due to gravity, and due to how pressure increases temperature, the nebulaic gas starts getting hotter. This process keeps going. </p>
